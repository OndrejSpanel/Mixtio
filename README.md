If you want to deploy your own build, you need to provide your own Client ID and Client Secret
from your own application API registration at https://www.strava.com/settings/api.

Put them in a file `resources/secret.txt`, with an ID and the secret each on its own line, like:

    12356
    47875454gae8974bcd798654
